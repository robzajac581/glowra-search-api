## üí∞ Cost Projections

| Scale | Current Setup | With CDN | With Full Features |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| **150 clinics** | $15/month | N/A | N/A |
| **500 clinics** | $30-50/month | $5-10/month | $20-40/month |
| **1000 clinics** | $75-100/month | $5-20/month | $50-100/month |
