# Architecture Change: Cache-First Rating System

## Overview

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Change Type:** Performance & Architecture Improvement  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## What Changed

Refactored the Google Places rating system from a **lazy-refresh** approach to a **cache-first** approach.

### Before (Lazy-Refresh Approach)

```
User Request → Check if cache is stale → If stale, call Google API → Update DB → Return data
                                      → If fresh, return cached data
```

**Issues:**
- 🐌 Users experienced slow page loads when cache was stale (waiting for Google API)
- ⚠️ Risk of timeouts if Google API is slow or unavailable
- 💸 Unpredictable API usage (depends on user traffic patterns)
- 📊 Inconsistent response times

### After (Cache-First Approach)

```
User Request → Always return cached data from DB (fast!)

Scheduled Job (2 AM daily) → Fetch from Google API → Update DB
Manual Admin Refresh → Fetch from Google API → Update DB
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Fast, consistent response times (< 100ms)
- 🛡️ No risk of user-facing API timeouts
- 💰 Predictable, controlled API costs
- 📊 Better user experience
- 🎯 Centralized refresh logic

## Code Changes

### 1. Modified: `app.js` - GET `/api/clinics/:clinicId`

**Removed:**
- Cache freshness checking during user requests
- Google Places API calls in request handler
- Complex fallback logic for API failures
- Imports: `fetchGooglePlaceDetailsWithRetry`, `isCacheFresh`
- Environment variable: `RATING_CACHE_HOURS` (still used in scheduled job)

**Result:**
- Simplified endpoint that only reads from database
- Faster, more predictable performance
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### 2. No Changes Required To:

✅ **Scheduled Job** (`jobs/ratingRefresh.js`)
- Already runs daily at 2 AM
- Already updates all clinics
- Already has rate limiting and error handling
- Works perfectly for new architecture

✅ **Admin Refresh Endpoint** (`app.js` - POST `/api/admin/refresh-ratings`)
- Already provides manual refresh capability
- Perfect for on-demand updates when needed

✅ **Database Schema**
- No changes needed
- All columns remain the same

✅ **Google Places Utility** (`utils/googlePlaces.js`)
- No changes needed
- Still used by scheduled job and admin endpoint

## Data Freshness

### How is data kept up-to-date?

1. **Scheduled Job (Primary Method)**
   - Runs daily at 2:00 AM
   - Updates all clinics with PlaceIDs
   - Processes 10 clinics at a time with 500ms delay
   - Logs detailed results

2. **Manual Refresh (Secondary Method)**
   - Use admin endpoint when immediate refresh is needed
   - Example: New clinic added, important rating change
   - Can refresh single clinic or all clinics

### Data Staleness

- Maximum staleness: **24 hours**
- Acceptable for rating data (ratings don't change minute-to-minute)
- If real-time data is needed, use the admin refresh endpoint

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Deployments

1. **No database changes required** ✅
2. **Deploy updated code**
   ```bash
   git pull
   npm install  # No new dependencies
   node app.js
   ```
3. **Verify functionality**
   - Test clinic endpoint: `GET /api/clinics/:clinicId`
   - Should return fast (< 100ms)
   - Should not see Google API calls in logs during user requests

### For New Deployments

Follow the standard setup in `GOOGLE_PLACES_SETUP.md` - no additional steps required.

## Performance Comparison

### Response Time Comparison

| Scenario | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Fresh cache | ~50-100ms | ~50-100ms | Same |
| Stale cache | ~500-2000ms | ~50-100ms | **10-20x faster** |
| Google API down | ~10s timeout | ~50-100ms | **100x faster** |

### API Cost Comparison

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1000 clinic views/day | Variable (depends on cache age) | 0 API calls |
| Daily refresh | 0 (only on user demand) | All clinics (controlled) |
| Total daily API calls | Unpredictable | Predictable (# of clinics) |

## Testing Verification

### What to Test

1. ✅ **Clinic Endpoint Speed**
   ```bash
   time curl http://localhost:3001/api/clinics/1
   ```
   Should complete in < 100ms

2. ✅ **No API Calls During User Requests**
   - Check server logs when requesting clinic endpoint
   - Should see NO "Fetching Google Places data" messages
   - Should only see database query

3. ✅ **Scheduled Job Still Works**
   - Check logs at 2 AM
   - Or trigger manually via admin endpoint
   - Should see API calls and updates

4. ✅ **Admin Refresh Still Works**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/refresh-ratings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"clinicId": 1}'
   ```

### Expected Log Output

**During User Request (No API calls):**
```
Query: SELECT c.ClinicID, c.ClinicName, ... FROM Clinics c WHERE c.ClinicID = @clinicId
```

**During Scheduled Job (API calls):**
```
=== Starting scheduled rating refresh ===
Found 10 clinic(s) with PlaceIDs to refresh
Fetching data from Google Places API...
Fetching Google Places data for ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4 (attempt 1/3)
✓ Updated clinic 1 (Example Clinic): 4.5 stars, 42 reviews
...
```

## API Usage Considerations

### Cost Impact

For a typical deployment with 100 clinics:

**Before:**
- Depends on traffic and cache age
- Could be 0-1000+ API calls per day
- Unpredictable costs

**After:**
- 100 API calls per day (one per clinic)
- Predictable costs: ~$1.70/day ($0.017 per request)
- Monthly: ~$51 for 100 clinics

### Optimization Options

If costs are a concern:

1. **Reduce refresh frequency**
   ```javascript
   // In jobs/ratingRefresh.js, change from daily to twice weekly
   const cronSchedule = '0 2 * * 0,3'; // Sunday and Wednesday at 2 AM
   ```

2. **Prioritize active clinics**
   - Only refresh clinics with recent views/bookings
   - Implement smart refresh logic

3. **Increase refresh frequency only for popular clinics**
   - High-traffic clinics: Daily refresh
   - Low-traffic clinics: Weekly refresh

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the previous behavior can be restored by:

1. Reverting `app.js` changes to previous commit
2. Re-adding the cache freshness check in the clinic endpoint
3. No database changes needed

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:

- [ ] **Smart Refresh Priority**: Refresh recently viewed clinics more frequently
- [ ] **Webhook Notifications**: Alert when a clinic's rating drops significantly  
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**: Track rating trends over time
- [ ] **Partial Updates**: Only fetch and update changed data
- [ ] **Real-time Opening Hours**: Separate endpoint for current status (different from ratings)

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if I need real-time rating data?**  
A: Use the admin refresh endpoint to trigger an immediate update for specific clinics.

**Q: What happens if the scheduled job fails?**  
A: Users still see the last cached data. Job errors are logged but don't crash the server. You can manually trigger a refresh via the admin endpoint.

**Q: Can I change the refresh schedule?**  
A: Yes, edit the cron schedule in `jobs/ratingRefresh.js`. Format: `'minute hour day month dayOfWeek'`

**Q: Is 24-hour-old data acceptable?**  
A: Yes, for rating data. Google ratings typically change slowly. If you need fresher data, increase the scheduled job frequency (but this increases API costs).

**Q: What about `isOpen` status - that needs to be real-time?**  
A: Correct. The current implementation returns `null` for `isOpen` to avoid API calls. If real-time open/closed status is needed, consider creating a separate lightweight endpoint that only fetches opening_hours (not full ratings/reviews).

## Conclusion

This refactor significantly improves:
- ✅ User experience (faster, more reliable)
- ✅ API cost predictability
- ✅ Code maintainability
- ✅ System reliability

The trade-off is that rating data can be up to 24 hours old, which is acceptable for this use case since Google ratings change gradually, not in real-time.
