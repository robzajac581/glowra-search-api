**Create New Clinic (<60% confidence):**
- Too low to trust
- Create as separate entity

## ‚úÖ Verification Queries

### Check Primera vs R.A.M (Should be separate)
```sql
SELECT ClinicID, ClinicName, Address, GoogleRating, GoogleReviewCount 
FROM Clinics 
WHERE ClinicName LIKE '%Primera%' OR ClinicName LIKE '%R.A.M%';
```

**Result:**
- ID 112: R.A.M Plastic Surgery (Chicago) - 5.0‚òÖ, 24 reviews ‚úÖ
- ID 127: Primera Plastic Surgery (Florida) - 4.8‚òÖ, 329 reviews ‚úÖ

### Check All Corrections
```sql
SELECT ClinicID, ClinicName, GoogleRating, GoogleReviewCount 
FROM Clinics 
WHERE ClinicID IN (123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130)
ORDER BY ClinicID;
```

**Result:** All 8 clinics properly created with complete Google data ‚úÖ

## üìù Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Threshold too low** - 40% confidence accepted matches that shouldn't have been
2. **Name similarity alone** - "Plastic Surgery" appears in many names, creating false positives
3. **Insufficient location verification** - Should have checked distances for all matches

### What We Fixed
1. ‚úÖ Implemented distance verification (km between clinics)
2. ‚úÖ Raised effective threshold to 60% minimum
3. ‚úÖ Added geographic validation layer
4. ‚úÖ Created verification scripts for quality assurance

### Best Practices Going Forward
- **Always verify distances** for matches <70% confidence
- **Check actual addresses** not just city names
- **Prefer creating new clinics** over forcing bad matches
- **Run verification scripts** after any consolidation
