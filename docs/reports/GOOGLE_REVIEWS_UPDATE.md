# Google Reviews Update

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully enabled Google review text retrieval for all clinics. Previously, only ratings and review counts were stored, but no review text. After investigation and a full refresh, reviews are now available for the majority of clinics.

## What Was Done

### 1. Investigation
- Tested Google Places API to verify review availability
- Discovered that Google DOES provide review text for most plastic surgery/cosmetic clinics
- Found that the database had old data without review content

### 2. Full Refresh
- Manually refreshed all 130 clinics using the admin endpoint
- Successfully retrieved reviews from Google Places API
- Stored up to 5 reviews per clinic with full text, author info, and timestamps

### 3. Results
- **130 clinics** processed successfully
- **0 failures** during refresh
- Most plastic surgery and cosmetic clinics now have review text available
- Each clinic has up to 5 reviews with:
  - Author name
  - Star rating (1-5)
  - Review text
  - Timestamp
  - Relative time ("3 months ago")
  - Profile photo URL

## Automatic Refresh System

### ✅ Already Configured

An automatic refresh system is **already in place** and running:

- **File:** `jobs/ratingRefresh.js`
- **Schedule:** Daily at 2:00 AM (EST)
- **Cron Expression:** `0 2 * * *`
- **Status:** Active and initialized in `app.js`

### How It Works

1. **Automated Daily Refresh:**
   - Runs every day at 2 AM
   - Fetches fresh ratings and reviews from Google Places API
   - Updates all clinics with PlaceIDs
   - Rate-limited (10 concurrent requests, 500ms delay) to avoid Google API limits

2. **Manual Refresh (If Needed):**
   ```bash
   # Refresh all clinics
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/refresh-ratings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}'
   
   # Refresh specific clinic
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/refresh-ratings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"clinicId": 9}'
   ```

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Check server logs for scheduled job output
   - Look for "=== Starting scheduled rating refresh ===" messages
   - Review success/failure counts in logs

## API Endpoint

### GET `/api/clinics/:clinicId`

Now returns full review data:

```json
{
  "ClinicID": 9,
  "ClinicName": "CG Cosmetic",
  "GoogleRating": 4.5,
  "GoogleReviewCount": 10632,
  "reviews": [
    {
      "author": "Melissa So",
      "rating": 5,
      "text": "The office at CG Cosmetics is beautiful...",
      "time": "2024-03-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "relativeTime": "8 months ago",
      "profilePhoto": "https://..."
    }
    // ... up to 5 reviews
  ]
}
```

## Important Notes

### Google API Limitations

1. **Maximum 5 reviews per place:**
   - This is a Google Places API limit, not our limitation
   - Google returns their "most relevant" 5 reviews

2. **Review text availability:**
   - Most plastic surgery/cosmetic clinics: ✅ Reviews available
   - Medical spas/aesthetic centers: ✅ Reviews available
   - Some hospitals: ⚠️ May have restricted data
   - Estimated coverage: ~90% of clinics have review text

3. **Data freshness:**
   - Reviews are cached in database for 24 hours
   - Daily refresh keeps data current
   - Manual refresh available if immediate update needed

## Frontend Integration

Reviews are now ready for frontend use:

```javascript
// Example: Display reviews
fetch(`/api/clinics/${clinicId}`)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    if (data.reviews && data.reviews.length > 0) {
      // Display reviews
      data.reviews.forEach(review => {
        console.log(`${review.author}: ${review.text}`);
      });
    } else {
      // Show "See reviews on Google" link
      console.log(`${data.GoogleReviewCount} reviews on Google`);
      console.log(`Link: ${data.ReviewsLink}`);
    }
  });
```

## Configuration Files

- **Scheduled Job:** `/jobs/ratingRefresh.js`
- **Google Places Utility:** `/utils/googlePlaces.js`
- **Admin Endpoint:** `/app.js` (lines 574-720)
- **Environment Variable:** `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` (required)

## Troubleshooting

### If reviews aren't showing:

1. Check if automatic refresh is running:
   ```bash
   # Look for cron job logs in server output
   grep "scheduled rating refresh" server.log
   ```

2. Run manual refresh:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/refresh-ratings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
   ```

3. Check API key:
   - Ensure `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
   - Verify billing is enabled in Google Cloud Console
   - Confirm "Places API" (legacy) is enabled

### If reviews are empty for a specific clinic:

- Some clinics may not have reviews on Google
- Check `GoogleReviewCount` - if it's 0 or very low, no reviews exist
- Visit the clinic's Google Maps page to verify reviews are public

## Next Steps

- ✅ System is operational - no action needed
- Monitor daily refresh logs to ensure continued operation
- Consider setting up alerts if refresh fails
- Review API usage in Google Cloud Console to stay within quotas
